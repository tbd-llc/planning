## Concept
**Working Title:** "Patsi" (Personal Application Tracking System Interface)

**Concept:** Job searching for any role is a royal pain in the a$$. There's a lot of balls to juggle between reading posts online, reading emails about posts online, applying, tailoring your application (resume / cover letter) to the role, follow up about the position, etc. and frankly it's bullsh!t that companies have all of these different ATS systems to manage a job search when job seekers only have their two hands and an email client.

Enter Patsi! Patsi aggregates your job search into a single tool that is managed either from your inbox or a web app. Her features include:

- Aggregating all of the jobs you receive in your job search emails (LinkedIn, DICE, Indeed, VentureFizz, etc.) into a single, easily filterable database (one job description, one record row)
- Read the parsed job description without ever having to leave your email and with a click of a button
- Generate a templated resume based off prior bullets you've used for other applications
- Generate a templated cover letter based off prior sentences / paragraphs you've used for other applications
- Navigate directly to the appropriate site to apply with your templated (and slightly tweaked) materials
- Track every application and be prompted to automatically follow up weekly, whether that's via LinkedIn or through direct email to the job poster
- Track each interaction with the employer (up to and including offer stage)
- Compare your job search metrics against others within your industry to see how well your job search strategy is performing against the average

...and so much more!
